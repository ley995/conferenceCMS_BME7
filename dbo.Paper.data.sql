In order to further improve the translation of these therapies into the clinic, it is highly desirable to monitor the immediate cellular engraftment, subsequent cell biodistribution and migration, and cell survival non-invasively over time. MRI cell tracking, with its superior spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue anatomical detail, is emerging as the technique of choice to monitor in real-time image-guided cell delivery and engraftment. Up until now, 10 clinical MRI cell tracking studies have been published, either using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIO) contrast agents or perfluorocarbon tracers. In order to immunoprotect enhance the survival of transplanted cells, semi-permeable alginate capsules have been used to encapsulate pancreatic islet cells and form a host-guest immunological barrier. Composite hydrogels have also been used to scaffold transplanted stem cells and create a microenvironment that is favorable for successful cell engraftment. Both these capsules and scaffolds can now be imaged by adding multimodal contrast agents and fluorine tracers. In addition, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI has been applied to enhance contrast for certain chemical groups that are abundant in the hydrogel scaffolds. With MR imaging being so versatile, it is expected to become a mainstay imaging technique in regenerative medicine.', 2701, N'2018-06-28 23:21:29', N'2018-06-28 23:19:08', N'Clinically Applicable MR Tracking of Naked, Scaffolded and Encapsulated Cells', NULL, N'Keynote Lecture by Jeff Bulte')

KRAS is among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors. To date it is still undruggable. Ras proteins consist of highly homologous catalytic domains, and flexible C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVRs) that differ significantly across Ras isoforms. We have been focusing on key mechanistic questions in oncogenic Ras biology from the structural and signaling standpoints. We ask: How do Ras isoforms attain oncogenic specificity at the membrane? How they selectively activate effectors and why is KRas4B the most prevalent are highly significant questions. We merge functional data with a conformational view to provide mechanistic insight. Cell-specific expression levels, pathway cross-talk and distinct interactions are the key; but conformational trends can modulate selectivity. There are two major pathways in oncogenic Ras-driven proliferation: MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3Kα/Akt/mTOR. All membrane-anchored, proximally-located, oncogenic Ras isoforms can promote Raf dimerization and fully activate MAPK signaling. So why the differential statistics of oncogenic isoforms in distinct cancers and what makes KRas so highly oncogenic? Many cell-specific factors may be at play. As a key factor, we suggest that because only KRas4B binds calmodulin, only KRas can fully activate PI3Kα/Akt signaling. We propose that full activation of both MAPK and PI3Kα/Akt proliferative pathways by oncogenic KRas4B – but not by HRas or NRas – may help explain why the KRas4B isoform is especially highly populated in certain cancers. We further discuss pharmacological implications.

Methods: Two steerable needle types were developed based on the proposed loop shaped flexible mechanism, called Active Sheath. Each needle consisted of a loop shaped stylet with a conical tip made of superelastic metal alloy Beta-titanium inserted into a fluororesin flexible cannula of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) needle kit with 1.3 mm outer diameter. Push and pull inputs applied to one of the proximal stylet ends can bend the needle right or left. Stylet (A) was thinned around the tip whereas stylet (B) was homogeneous. A robotic steerable system was developed to ensure accurate and precise inputs. The designs were implemented in agar phantom using two input patterns: (1) push and (2) push and pull sequentially.
Results: Needle paths with input pattern (1) could be curved depending on input magnitude from 0–0.5 mm at 0.1 mm intervals. Lateral distance for stylet (B) curved path with 0.4 mm input was 35.9 mm from the standard straight path and 16.9 % longer than that from stylet (A). Compared with stainless steel and flexible bevel tip needles, stylet (B) distances were 3.1 times longer and 8.5% shorter, respectively. The proposed steerable needles could follow S shaped paths using input (2), and stylet (A) lateral distances were 1.9 times those for stylet (B).

Methods: A unique MR-compatible high-definition (HD) endoscope was developed to access to a target organ from outside the scanner bore by obtaining the endoscope optical camera and scan images simultaneously. The camera unit consists of a CMOS image sensor with 400 x 400 pixels. The camera head and the lens barrel are made of phosphor bronze and a Pebax elastomer sheath with a 2.1 mm diameter shielded by tin-plated copper wires. The image resolution was up-converted to 700 x 700 pixels by using a high-resolution image processing technique. The endoscope had two working channels (2.0 mm in each outer diameter) and two sensor ports (2.5 mm in each outer diameter). One port had a gradient-magnetic-based tracking sensor to identify the tip position and orientation; the outer diameter and length of the endoscope were 11 mm and 1,200 mm. A pig was scanned as a pre-procedural MR image and the result was used as navigation images to assess endoscope''s feasibility. 
Results: The camera image quality was sufficient to identify organs without critical noise during scanning, and its resolution was about 295 times that of the conventional MR-compatible fiber endoscope we have developed. The refresh rates of the sensor position and orientation were < 0.5 s, which includes data transmission from the scanner to the navigation software.

There are many biological signal measurement systems such as BIOPAC and evaluation boards for specific signals. However, most of these boards and systems are manufactured for research, not for educational purpose. Thus these are many limitations in adding or modifying circuits directly. Therefore, we developed a bio-signal acquisition and processing system(BMDAQ) that is highly utilized in educational purpose.

[Materials and methods] 
The BMDAQ(Biomedical Data Acquisition) board consists of an analog board, a digital board and PC application programs, as well as teaching materials of educational lectures. 
We designed an analog board using three Op-Amps instrumentation amplifiers instead of a single chip for electrocardiogram(ECG). This is designed as a removable expansion type for several other applications and is manufactured so that students can do soldering for themselves. 
The digital board is designed to convert the signal coming from the analog board into digital and transmit the data to the PC through serial communication. The microcontroller used in the digital board is MSP430(TI, USA) and we used the internal 12-bit ADC. An external 24-bit ADC was used to acquire a bio-signal with high resolution. Especially, we isolated the signal and power from the human body for safety which is the most important factor in medical devices. The application program provides real-time filtering of biomedical signal and display of original and filtered signal. 

[Results and Conclusion] 
BMDAQ board and textbook were designed and produced for educational purpose and have been used as teaching materials and laboratory equipment in biomedical/electronic related engineering department of many universities in Korea for 10 years. We plan to upgrade BMDAQ to reflect new trends in these days, and will add new modules such as pulse oximeter, EEG and IMU(Inertia Measurements Units).

In this paper we present a medical instrument, called Ultrasonic Measurer to measure human body height and weight using a non-contact approach.

All the measurements and estimations are implemented on males and females with various body shapes. The proposed method proved to give good results, when the sizes are estimated with errors less than 0.5% and weight is estimated with error less than 3.5%.

Fattigation platform nanoparticles based on covalent conjugation of natural and biocompatible proteins (gelatin, transferrin, serum albumin etc.) and fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid, stearic acid etc.) have shown immense pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical potentials in recent years. The term “fattigation” is defined as the covalent conjugation between natural proteins and fatty acids to form new amphiphilic biomaterials. These amphiphilic conjugates can readily form a self-assembled nanoparticle when exposed to an aqueous environment. It offers several advantages such as efficient active (click chemistry, folic acid receptor) as well as passive (enhanced permeability retention effect) targeting, enhanced solubility and bioavailability, and diagnostic imaging. In a first study, novel bioconjugates of gelatin and oleic acid (GOC) were synthesized in an aqueous solvent method by overcoming completely contrast solubility of gelatin and oleic acid. Recently, more stable covalent conjugation between gelatin-oleic acid have also been carried out using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide / N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) with and without toxic cross-linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Formed GOC and gelatin-oleic nanoparticles (GONs) have been extensively characterized physico-chemically by various analytical methods. Particle size of GON has been found in the range of 200-300 nm with superior drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies. Until now, various water insoluble and soluble drugs irrespective of their pH behavior such as, paclitaxel (PTX), irinotecan, doxorubicin, valsartan, telmisartan and aceclofenac have been successfully encapsulated and their effects on in vitro and in vivo models have been evaluated. In a pharmacokinetic (PK) study on mouse models of various cancers, PTX-loaded and folic acid-surface modified GON showed improved therapeutic effects on tumors with significant reduction in toxicity associated with Taxol®. Drug-loaded self-assembled GONs with different pH-dependent solubilities (valsartan, telmisartan and aceclofenac) have shown enhanced solubility (solubilities after 48 hours at 37 ºC - 931.6, 402.2 and 384.5 µg/ml, respectively) compared to each drug alone (85.1, 0.28, 11.8 µg/ml, respectively). Furthermore, fattigation platform nanoparticles have also demonstrated potential for theranostic purposes. To evaluate potential of GON as diagnostic markers for MRI, PTX-loaded superparamagnetic surface-modified GONs (GOAS-MNPs) were incubated with cancer cells and the signal intensity was measured. The signal intensity of the T2-weighted images was decreased together with an increase in iron concentration indicating the use of GONs as MRI contrast agents in biological systems. Most recently, receptor driven active targeting by transferrin and bioorthogonal click chemistry has also been achieved through transferrin-stearic nanoparticles (TfS NPs) and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-modified GON (GON-DBCO). Further assessment of fattigation platform nanoparticles in presence of biomimetic shear stress as well as protein corona has been performed to facilitate the understanding of in vivo behavior of these nanoparticles. In conclusion, fattigation platform nanoparticles provide a robust, safe and efficient targeted drug delivery platform.

Oral administration is more convenient for patients; however, current medications for UC are not effective due to instability in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, non-specific distribution, and severe adverse effects. To address these issues, we have developed a novel oral redox nanoparticles (RNP), which was prepared by self-assembly of methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(4-[2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl]oxymethylstyrene)] (MeO-PEG-b-PMOT), an amphiphilic block copolymer with stable nitroxide radicals (TEMPO), ROS scavengers, in a hydrophobic segment as a side chain via an ether linkage. After oral administration, RNP highly accumulated in colon region, and specifically diffused into colonic mucosa of inflamed sites. As compared to low molecular weight compounds, orally administered RNP effectively scavenged overproduced ROS in the inflamed colon, resulting in suppression of inflammation in mice model of colitis. Interestingly, when anticancer drug irinotecan (Iri) was administered in combination with RNP, a remarkable suppression of tumor growth was observed in CAC model mice treated with combination compared to mice treated with Iri alone. In addition, the Iri-induced adverse effects, such as diarrhea and GI inflammation, were remarkably reduced by oral administration of RNP. We also confirmed that long-term oral administration of RNP exhibited extremely low toxicity in mice due to a lack of RNP absorption into the bloodstream and less uptake by healthy intestinal cells. Another toxicity evaluation on zebrafish embryos showed that TEMPOL induces severe mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the dead of all zebrafish embryos while RNP did not cause mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish embryos, and no zebrafish dead was observed, indicating that RNP did not disturb intracelluar redox balance.

The most important factors impacting the accuracy of pedicle screws are the entrance point and the angle of screw. CPS with ideal entrance point and angle is usually guided by navigation or screw guide template system. In Vietnam, there are no studies about using intra-operatively ideal entrance point and angle of screw for CPS placement.PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the method of using the intra-operatively ideal entrance point of screw and the angle of pedicle axis and frontal plane with a set square for lower CPS placement, and to determine the accurate position of screws.METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed 10 consecutive patients with cervical spine injuries who underwent lower CPS fixation with our method.Preoperatively, we selected axial slide with biggest pedicle diameter on CT scanner; in this axial slide, we determined the ideal entrance point of CPS (the insertion point of pedicle axis line and surface of lateral mass), measured the distances between ideal entrance point and lateral margin of lateral mass (distance L), and measured angle of pedicle axis line and frontal plane (angle PF).We applied Abumi’s technique to insert CPS, but intraoperatively the set square determined the ideal entrance point (by distance L, it located in pedicle axis on sagittal plane). After making the entrance hole, we put the straight probe into this hole, the angle of the frontal plane and straight probe is equal to angle PF, that was measured by a set square. After having the ideal entrance point and angle of screws, pedicle probe, tap and screws were inserted into the pedicle.The accuracy of CPS placement was evaluated on postoperative CT scanner. RESULTS: Sixty two CPS (C3-C7) were inserted, the mean angle PF and distance L were 43.6±5.0º and 2.2±1.0mm. Postoperative CT scanner showed: 59 (95.2%) screws of Grade 0 (Screw is completely within the wall of the bone structure) and 3 (4.8%) screws of Grade 1 (Screw perforates the wall of the bone structure, but more than 50% of the screw diameter remained within the bone). There were no identified complications related to CPS. CONCLUSION: Using intraoperative set square enables us to determine exact entry point and angle of screws, therefore increasing accuracy of lower CPS by 95.2%.ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The authors would like to thank Professor Kuniyoshi Abumi for his teaching and his comments about this article.', 2714, N'2018-06-27 14:55:00', N'2018-06-27 15:25:00', N'Using the Set Square to Determine the Ideal Entrance Point and Angle of Screw for Lower Cervical Pedicle Screw Placement', NULL, N'Tran Hoang Manh, Vo Van Thanh')

These approaches may well be the "lowest-hanging fruit" in the stem cell field.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have the potential to serve as in vitro models of disease for the purpose of (a) unveiling novel pathophysiological mechanisms; (b) pinpointing biomarkers, prognostics, & diagnostics; (c) elucidating the mechanisms-of-action of extant drugs; (d) revealing novel drug targets; (e) potentially discovering new drugs.

An approach that has been brought about, in part, by a crisis in development studies and a loss of faith in key paradigms and ‘grand narratives’ in development theory and strategy. 
The dislocation of a grand narrative implies that economic transformation is essentially a process of ‘self-discovery’ with no fixed directionality in growth trajectories. For example, policy makers who focus attention on the question, is Artificial Intelligence (AI) the biggest threat to future employment, appear to ignore the more pressing question, is financialization a bigger threat to employment than automation?
There is also limited opportunity to transplant a successful development strategy from one setting to another. Economic development is, therefore, fundamentally a process characterised by experimentation and learning; a principle in the nascent field of ‘entrepreneurial innovation. All economies are laboratories for growth, both in terms of how it occurs and how it can be made “balanced” and “healthy”. However, innovation policies remain wedded to the linear model of innovation and the competitiveness framework, which continues to be the dominant paradigm. However, it has been argued elsewhere that entrepreneurial innovation is the true source of national competitive advantage. Although, the question of context has received little attention, entrepreneurial innovation itself, involves the disruption of existing industries and creation of new ones through multi-level processes and stakeholders, multiple actors and multiple contexts that constitute different entrepreneurial ecosystems. Such ecosystems help regulate the direction and quality of entrepreneurial innovation by shaping the direction and potential rewards of alternative courses of technological development and even the types of organisational forms that will be accepted as legitimate. Universities play a crucial and highly complex role in enriching these ecosystems that goes way beyond technology transfer indicators.  Alternative value measures allow us to consider the needs of micro and small businesses through the lens of the entrepreneurial university, as a regional anchor institution.  Here, the term ‘anchor institution’ can be used to describe an organisation that has an important presence in the local community and makes a strategic contribution to the local economy. I will seek to highlight the way universities can take a lead role as an anchor institution within its region. With the anchor institution at its heart, entrepreneurial ecosystems, could be seen as a more inclusive alternative, to the Washington Consensus (aka Shock Therapy) for many countries.

SNP rs4284505 located on miRNA 17 – 92 cluster host gene exhibits the strong association with breast cancer in Caucasian Australian. Therefore, in this study, SNP rs4284505 is investigated to determine whether it can relate to breast cancer in Vietnamese patients. High Resolution Melting (HRM) method has been optimized to screen selected SNP, aiming at predicting the correlation of the chosen SNP and breast cancer in Vietnam. The total of 100 breast cancer samples were collected from Oncology hospital and would be compared with 101 healthy samples whose data was obtained from 1000 Genome Database. The result showed that, the optimal HRM protocol was constructed with high sensitivity (up to 95%), specificity and stability. The polymorphism rs4284505 does occur in Vietnamese population with the frequencies of two alleles G and A being 44.27% and 55.73%, respectively. And the presence of G allele seems likely to have the protective effect on susceptibility to breast cancer because OR was less than 1 [OR (95%CI) = 0.80 (0.54–1.18)]. Nevertheless, because the p-value is greater than threshold (>0.05) in all genetic models, this SNP is predicted not to be associated with breast cancer risk.

Biliary atresia is a rare defect and of high fatality in infants; the causes remain unknown. At present, immediate surgery or liver transplantation has been obligatory due to deteriorating conditions. Unfortunately, infants in Vietnam who develop biliary atresia symptoms do not likely receive timely diagnoses or operations due to the high cost or lack of available support programs. Recently, GCSF has been reported that potentially improved the conditions of patients suffering from both liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of GCSF on the pathological condition induced by bile duct ligation in the mouse model. 
Materials and methods 
Healthy Balb/c mice, 4-6 weeks of age, 20-25 grams were divided into three groups including sham, placebo, and GCSF-treated (n=4-5 mice/group). The bile duct was ligated using the surgery silk. Next, 10µg/kg/day G-CSF was subcutaneously injected for five consecutive days. Mice were humanely euthanized to collect blood and liver samples. The criteria included the total leukocyte count, neutrophil count, serum enzymes activity, inflammation/fibrosis-related mRNA levels, fibrosis-corresponding proteins expression, pathohistological evaluation. 
Results 
Bile duct ligated mice significantly presented distinct indications including ruffling, jaundice. Bile duct ligated mice could not survive more than 14 days. However, giving G-CSF increased the survival proportion and extended the lifespan of treated mice. Also, mice given GCSF had their TGF-β, α-SMA and procollagen mRNA levels significantly reduced. These results were consistent with those of protein expression. GCSF might have positive effects lowering infarction areas as well as collagen and α-SMA accumulation. 
Conclusion 
G-CSF could reduce the inflammation, and progressing of the fibrosis which posibly contributed to a more intact liver structure and a longer lifespan of treated mice.

The patient demographic variables collected were medical history, systemic and genetic conditions (IL-1 polymorphism or Type 1 & 2 Diabetes Miletus) and social habits (smoking and alcohol). Digital x-rays, implant survival assessment and clinical evaluation were used to analyze the data. Results and discussion: There was a 100% implant survival rate over five years.

Materials and methods: Data was gathered from 46 patients who received oral regenerative therapy using CGF within the last three years in a private dental clinic. CGF mixture of demineralized freeze-dried bone (DFDB sticky bone) and fibrin membrane was obtained from the patient’s centrifuged blood. Patient medical history, demographic details, social habits, vital signs, oral hygiene status, digital radiographs, clinical observation and photos, survival rate as well as numeric pain intensity scale and visual analogue satisfaction scale were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. Results and discussion: All patients had uneventful outcomes in terms of wound healing complications and satisfaction. No patients reported of failure. Though factors like smoking, poor oral hygiene status, periodontitis, and medical conditions such as diabetes have been recognized in the literature, they had no statistical significance in this study. However, gender and age showed statistical significance with the following variables: more males with SDB than females; more older patients (>50 years old) with SDB and high blood than those under 50. Conclusion: Using the limited patient data available in the last three years in this study, it was found that CGF is a novel approach for regeneration of defective oral tissues, especially in males and older patients with SDB and high blood pressure.

Oral mucosal vaccine could induce effective systemic immune responses together with mucosal immunity because microfold cells (M cells) are responsible for antigen uptake and a useful delivery route for vaccines and pharmaceutical agents. However, the lacks of the resources of M cells hinder the development of oral mucosal vaccines. Taking advantage of the reversible association-dissociation between GSH and GST, GSH modified SiNW-FETs herein were used to anchor a particular GST-fused protein receptor from M cells, Claudin-4, for the studies of oral mucosal vaccine development. Our findings showed the reversible GSH-GST functionality on the SiNW-FETs has made this sensorial device consecutively reusable and calibratable, allowing for the observation of the interaction of GST-receptors and developed vaccines. Through the results that the developed vaccines CPE12, CPE13, CPE16, CPE21-MUT, CPE30 can interact with the GST-receptors on the SiNW-FET device. By using the SiNW-FET, we can quickly observe that can the developed vaccines work in the short time.', 2812, N'2018-06-28 17:05:00', N'2018-06-28 17:30:00', N'33.The Platform of Vaccine Development Using Silicon Nanowire Field-Effect Transistors', N'https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HVw0o1x2R9Kg0X2-BhjuScsHJO8fQbmI', N'Kai-Wei Shih and Shu-Ping Lin')

Our HPE system consists of four steps: hands detection and segmentation, right and left hand classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, hand pose estimation using a deep CNN regressor, and 3D hand pose reconstruction. First, both hands are detected and segmented from each RGB and depth images using skin detection and depth cutting algorithms. Second, a CNN classifier is used to distinguish right and left hands. Our CNN classifier consists of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, and uses the segmented depth images as input. Third, a trained deep CNN regressor estimates the key sixteen joints of hands in 3D from the segmented left and right depth hands separately. The regressor is hierarchically composed of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers and dense fully connected layers to estimate the hand joints from the segmented hand depth images. Finally, 3D hand pose of each hand gets reconstructed from the estimated hand joints. The results show that our CNN classifier distinguishes the right and left hands with an accuracy of 96.9%. The 3D human hand poses are estimated with an average distance error of 8.48mm. The presented HPE system can be used in various application fields including medical VR, AR, and MR applications.

In Cambodia, recent national surveys have indicated that 43–48% of adult men smoke cigarettes. In people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), for whom the health risks associated with tobacco use are disproportionally high, 65% of HIV+ men and 5% of HIV+ women smoke cigarettes. Thus, complimenting HIV treatment with efficacious tobacco cessation treatment offers tremendous potential to greatly improve the medical management of HIV and to prolong life for PLWH. 

OBJECTIVE: This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of a fully automated, interactive smartphone-delivered intervention for smoking cessation among PLWH in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 

METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial with 50 PLWH recruited through a HIV clinic in Phnom Penh. Participants were randomized to one of two intervention arms: Standard Care (SC; n=25), and Automated Messaging (AM; n=25). SC consists of brief advice to quit smoking delivered by research staff and written self-help materials. AM consists of SC components plus a fully automated and interactive smartphone-based treatment program, delivered by our Insight™ platform and app. Participants were followed up for 2 months. Their self-report smoking status was assessed weekly through Insight, and was biochemically confirmed at 2-month follow-up. 

RESULTS: The abstinence prevalence at 2 months were 40% for AM group and 8% for SC group (relative risk: 5.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.2–20.5). Among those who did not quit smoking at 2 months, the median numbers of cigarettes smoked per day reduced 67%; this reduction was similar for both groups. 

CONCLUSION: The smartphone-based AM intervention for smoking cessation is efficacious and has the potential for wide-scale adoption in Cambodia and in other developing countries.

For example, the Da Vinci robot enables robotic surgeries, and Ardian enables surgical treatment of refractory hypertension. More recently, there has been a profound shift in emphasis on technologies that can provide cost-saving values to the payers. To this end, value signposts are fundamental in identifying and addressing clinical needs on a global scale. These value signposts include the potential to keep patients out of the hospital, change location of care to less expensive venues, and diagnose a condition earlier to reduce complications and/or slow disease progression. These presentations will review the key value signposts for translating health science technology and apply them to two case studies.
Case 1: Even with readily available Emergency Medical Service and well equipped tertiary medical centres dotted across Singapore, the rate of patients with ischemic stroke receiving thrombolysis is low at 6.3%. Patients missing the window for thrombolysis have worse clinical outcome and require expensive rehabilitation. Our Singapore Stanford Biodesign team developed an app to identify the three most common symptoms of stroke and automatically activate medical response. 
Case 2: Our team of physicians from Singapore and the United States identified a scarcity of nasoendoscope in Vietnam. Only 45% of central and regional hospitals have nasoendoscopes whereas no community or district hospitals have such capacity. The team developed an affordable, LED-based, cord-free, AAA-battery-powered nasoendoscope system with data acquisition and transmission circuitry. This device can potentially add significant value to the delivery of ENT care in Vietnam and beyond.

The prevalence of OSAS is much higher in patients with heart failure, coronary disease, and diabetes. OSAS is also associated with increased risk of cardio and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. The potential etiological mechanisms of these events may include endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and metabolism and coagulation disorders. Currently, an over-night polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of OSAS. Unfortunately, overnight PSG is an onerous, expensive, and inconvenience test for any age and that why the quest for alternative diagnostic tools are necessary. Among them, there is a special interest involving the potential biomarkers of OSA. The concept of using biomarkers in association with daytime consequences of OSA to improve diagnosis and monitoring OSA has been developed in the last decade.

Baseline levels of ST2 were significantly higher in those patients who died (<35 ng/ml versus >35 ng/mL, P=0,01) or developed new congestive heart failure (< 35 ng/ml versus > 35 ng/mL, P=0.002) by 30 days. In an analysis of outcomes at 30 days by ST2 quartiles, both death (P=0.01) and the combined death/heart failure end point (p=0.001) showed a significant graded association with levels of ST2. Furthermore, when sST2 > 35 ng/ml and BNP > 500 pg/ml showed a tightly relationship with cardiac outcomes within 30 days (P<0,0001). Conclusions: Serum levels of the interleukin-1 receptor family member ST2 predict mortality and heart failure in patients with STEMI. These data suggest that ST2 and BNP are the useful biomarker in short-term prognosis of cardiac events in STEMI.', 2910, N'2018-06-29 10:47:33', N'2018-06-29 11:10:04', N'135.

Diabetic neuropathy is characterized by a distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and its incidence increases in patients 40 years of age or older. In spite of extensive research over decades, there are few effective treatments for diabetic neuropathy besides glucose control and improved lifestyle. The earliest changes in diabetic neuropathy occur in sensory nerve fibers, with initial degeneration and regeneration resulting in pain. To seek its effective treatment, here we prepared a type-2 diabetic mouse model by giving mice 2 injections of streptozotocin and nicotinamide and examining the ability for nerve regeneration by using a sciatic nerve transection-regeneration model previously established by us. Seventeen weeks after the last injection, the mice exhibited symptoms of type-2 diabetes, i.e., impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin level, mechanical hyperalgesia, and impaired sensory nerve fibers in the plantar skin. These mice showed delayed functional recovery and nerve regeneration by 2 weeks compared with young healthy mice and by 1 week compared with age-matched non-diabetic mice after axotomy. Furthermore, type-2 diabetic mice displayed increased expression of PTEN in their DRG neurons. Administration of a PTEN inhibitor at the cutting site of the nerve for 4 weeks promoted the axonal transport and functional recovery remarkably. The present study demonstrates that peripheral nerve regeneration was impaired in type-2 diabetic model and that its combination with sciatic nerve transection is suitable for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of early diabetic neuropathy.', 2910, N'2018-06-29 10:45:02', N'2018-06-29 11:04:43', N'204.

The most popular one is the binding free energy which can be estimated by several methods in conventional molecular dynamics simulation. So far in steered molecular dynamics (SMD) one can use either the rupture force or non-equilibrium pulling work as a measure for binding affinity. We have shown that the non-equilibrium binding free energy ΔGneqJar, obtained by Jarzynski’s equality at a finite pulling speed, has good correlation with experimental data on inhibition constants implying that this quantity can be used as a good scoring function for binding affinity. In addition the rupture time as well as binding and unbinding free energy barriers are also good descriptors for binding affinity. Our observation is useful for fast screening of potential leads as the SMD simulation is not time consuming. 
Fibril formation resulting from protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Despite much progress in understanding the protein aggregation process, the factors governing fibril formation rates and fibril stability have not been fully understood. In the second part of my talk I show that the kinetic stability of the fibril state can be accessed via mechanical stability in such a way that the higher mechanical stability or kinetic stability the faster fibril formation. This result opens up a new way for predicting fibril formation rates based on the mechanical stability which may be easily estimated by SMD method.

Prion diseases have been widely studied, but despite many great leaps in our knowledge many gaps in our knowledge are still unknown, especially in prion conformational conversion mechanism. In this work, we perform an amino acid scan at histidine (H)95, a key regulator residue within proposed prion conversion of the fifth copper-binding site. We created a series of mutant PrP by replacing H95 with every other common amino acid and compared the prion conversion propensity by ScN2a assay. The results are remarkable with the residues with electrically-charged side chains (H95D, H95E, H95K and H95R) decreasing prion conversion by about 50-75%, compared to wild-type (wt) PrP. We next analyze the localization, trafficking and biochemical features of PrP H95E, the most promising mutant for reducing conversion, in N2aPrP−/− cells stably transfected with the mutant PrP. The only difference observed was relative to the endosomal recycling compartments, with mutant PrP H95E showing less co-localization compared to WT PrP. This is in agreement with other work that links the endosomal recycling compartments with prion conversion. We conclude that the replacement of PrP H95 with electrically charged side chains decreases the prion conversion propensity, and this is likely due to reduced co-localization with the endosomal recycling compartments.

In mammals, four MT isoforms exist (MT -1/4). Human MTs are monomeric proteins of 61-68 amino acids characterized by a conserved array of 20 cysteines involved in coordination of d10 metal ions in two separated metal-thiolates clusters. Despite their sequence and metal coordination similarity, the MT-3 isoform expressed in the central nervous system possesses unique structural and biological functions not shared by other isoforms. MT-3 antagonizes the ability of Alzheimer’s disease brain extract to stimulate neuritic sprouting of neurons, possesses neuronal growth inhibitory activity, and protects neurons from the toxic effect of amyloid-β (Aβ). Our work is demonstrating the central protective role by MT -3 from Cu(II) toxicity by controlling aberrant copper-protein interactions and amyloid aggregation in the brain. MT-3 scavenges Cu(II) from soluble, oligomeric, and aggregated amyloidogenic proteins via metal-swap reactions. Zn7MT- 3 thiolates efficiently reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) and bind it to form Cu(I)4Zn4MT-3 via cooperative formation of an unprecedented redox-inert Cu(I)4-thiolate cluster in its β-domain, in which unique metal-metal interactions exists. This reactivity underlies its protective effect against amyloid-Cu(II) toxicity.
We have addressed the structural reasons underlying the copper-thionein character in MT-3 over other MTs. We defined the process of Cu(II) reduction and Cu(I)-thiolate cluster assembly in Zn7MT-3, its Cu(I) binding and redox-silencing properties, and compared them to other MT isoforms. By using spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques we reveal a novel pathway for Cu(I)4-thiolate cluster formation in which unique long-lived metal-stabilized disulphide radical anions are formed. By conducting mutational studies, we revealed how non-coordinating residues are instrumental for imparting metal selectivity bias and unique functional properties in MT-3. The study contributes to the fundamental understanding on how sequence, structure and metal coordination overall determine metal selectivity, reactivity and function in MTs.

In the first part, we will present novel methods of computational analysis of signal propagation mechanisms and communication pathways in proteins. The analysis is carried out using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with a signal propagation model. We elucidate the mechanisms of signal propagation and determine hot spot residues involved in the regulation of the functionally oriented aspects of protein conformational dynamics. Interestingly, we find that different communication mechanisms are triggered by different ligands. This information is then used to design and synthesize new allosteric modulators of the internal dynamics as well as the interactions properties of the targeted proteins. The activities of the modulators are tested in various models in vitro and in vivo.
In the second part, we discuss new methods to investigate the role of sequence and structures in determining the interaction properties of proteins and domains. In particular, we focus on the prediction of antibody-binding sites: Epitope prediction has in fact proven challenging. The antibody binding properties of an antigen depend on its structure and related dynamics. To this end, we have developed an integrated analysis of the dynamical and energetic properties of antigens, to identify non-optimized, low-intensity energetic interaction-networks in the protein structure isolated in solution. The method is based on the idea that recognition sites may correspond to localized regions with low-intensity energetic couplings with the rest of the protein allowing them to undergo conformational changes, to be recognized by a binding partner and to tolerate mutations with minimal energetic expense. Analyzing the results on isolated proteins and benchmarking against antibody-complexes, the method successfully identifies binding sites located on the protein surface and accessible by putative binding partners. The combination of dynamics and energetics can thus discriminate between epitopes and other substructures based only on physical properties. 
Next, we test our predictions on a series of antigens from B.pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for melioidosis, a serious and often fatal infectious disease that is poorly controlled by existing treatments. Predicted epitopes are engineered as synthetic peptides and shown to be selectively immunorecognized to the same extent as recombinant proteins in sera from melioidosis-affected subjects. Moreover, antibodies raised against designed sequences prove to be bactericidal. 
Finally we will discuss the implication of these methods in drug and vaccine discovery.

Nowadays, we have known that acetylation of histones plays an indispensable role in the development of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. Many studies have shown that an increase in histone acetylation levels leads to an enhanced gene expression, zygotic gene activation (ZGA), epigenetic modification, and finally increase the development of cloned embryos to the blastocyst stage and full-term. For enhancement of histone acetylation, many histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were used to improve the development of cloned embryos such as Trichostatin A (TSA), Scriptaid, aroyl pyrrole hydroxy amide (APHA) compound 8, Oxamflatin ect. In addition, for the timing of HDACi treatment, most scientists focused on treatment of somatic cell before or after SCNT, or some reports prolong the treatment time during the first cell cycle of cloned embryos. Many reports have concluded that HDACi treatment after SCNT, during the time of activation, and the first cell cycle of SCNT oocytes improved the development rates of cloned embryos. Currently, most studies are focused on enhancing the reprogramming of somatic genetic materials only during the first cell cycle. However, one of the most important event that determine the successful development of fertilized and cloned embryos is acquirement of ZGA, which occur in different stages of each species, Therefore, the effects of different timing for HDACi treatment on the ZGA in porcine and bovine cloned embryos is still unclear. 
In this talk, I will report the timing of ZGA and the expression of histone acetylation during preimplantation development in the mouse, porcine and bovine. Next, the effects of the timing of HDACi treatment on animals cloned embryos will be discussed. Finally, it will be presented a new protocol “two-step treatment” for HDACi treatment on the development of cloned embryos in the mouse, porcine, and bovine.

Reproductive biologists have been trying to repeat some parts or entire process of oogenesis in vitro to reveal the underlying mechanisms of oogenesis as well as to utilize ovarian oocytes as a source of fertile eggs. After the initial success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) of mature oocytes (eggs), in vitro matured (IVM) oocytes have been used for IVF to produce offspring. Today, IVF and IVM are widely used in agricultural and medical fields as the new strategy for animal production and infertility treatment. These in vitro techniques also have contributed to accumulation of fundamental knowledge of in vivo oocyte maturation and fertilization in mammals. 
Mammalian ovaries store a huge number of oocytes. Since Dr. John Eppig reported the first systematic culturing study using mouse growing oocytes in 1977, many efforts have been made to develop and improve in vitro growth (IVG) culture systems for oocytes in various species. In 1996, he and his colleagues grew mouse oocytes in primordial follicles into fertile eggs by IVG. In 2016, Dr. Hayashi and his colleagues achieved great success by producing fertile eggs from mouse ES cells and iPS cells in vitro covering the entire process of oogenesis. On the other hand, significant hurdles have yet to be overcome before full establishment of IVG systems for domestic species. Three Japanese groups produced bovine offspring from growing oocytes (90 - 100 µm in diameter) collected from early antral follicles, by IVG-IVM-IVF. After the first successful report in 1999, IVG systems for domestic species have been improved. 
I will review the advances in oocyte IVG systems mainly based on our results, and introduce our recent culture system using oocyte-cumulus complexes from early antral follicles. I will also discuss some determinant factors involved in the successful IVG system for domestic animals.

However, the offspring rate of the ROSI-derived zygotes is still low and the causes of this were not revealed. To elucidate the causes of the lower offspring rate of ROSI-zygotes, we planed to analyze the chromatin structure in ROSI-zygotes. It is known that in the fertilized zygotes with matured sperm (IVF, ICSI), several kinds of epigenetic factors show parental asymmetric pattern. In contrast to this, interestingly, a previous report found that some epigenetic factors showed disrupted parental asymmetric pattern in ROSI-zygotes. Recently, we established zygotic fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (zFRAP) with using eGFP tagged histone H2B (eGFP-H2B). zFRAP can reveal chromatin looseness in the zygotes. In IVF zygotes, the paternal chromatin is higher loosened than female one. Thus, chromatin looseness is also parental asymmetric in IVF zygotes. Currently, in order to apply this analytical method to ROSI-zygotes, we are trying to establish ROSI zFRAP experimental system.

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified nearly 5,000 proteins from 8,000 mouse embryos of each stage (zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst). We found that protein expression in zygotes, morulas, and blastocysts is distinct from 2- to 8-cell embryos. Next, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to obtain a system wide understanding of groups of proteins whose co-expression patterns are highly correlated during embryonic development. Two types of the proteins were separated: 1. highly expressed in the zygote, but rapidly degraded after 2-cell stage; 2. maintained their expression levels until morula, and sharply increase in blastocyst. From the network, some important proteins essential for germ-cell development and early development were defined as core factors in this module. We further hypothesize that proteins highly expressed in the blastocyst and with high connectivity might be indispensable during early embryo development. We injected small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into MII oocytes followed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to knock down these genes in embryogenesis. Strikingly, the KD of Rrp9, a component of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, completely blocked the morula-to-blastocyst transition. We measured the global gene expression changes after Rrp9 KD embryos in the morula stage by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and identified 625 and 514 genes up- and downregulated after Rrp9 KD. GO analysis revealed that apoptosis-related genes were upregulated in Rrp9 knock-down embryos. Additional immunostaining results confirmed that Rrp9 KD embryos showed notable apoptosis after the morula stage.

Direct intramyocardial injection helped to retain more grafted cells than intracoronary grafting. It could also cause cardiac muscle damages due to injection and the number of cell loss was rather high. In order to overcome these difficulties, we aimed to transplant stem cell sheet on myocardial ischemic mice. The results showed that grafted cell sheet adhered to heart tissue well after 14 days of transplantation. After grafting, histological analysis showed that the grafts of cell sheet group were more evenly distributed than those of injected group. The heart muscle of the MSCs injected mice had some cardiac muscle damages due to the effects of the needle while the heart tissue of cell sheet group was without damages. The fibrosis area of cell sheet group was smaller than that of injected group’s and control group 2. Transplanted cells were observed in both cell sheet group and injected group after 14 days of graft.

However, when freeze-dried spermatozoa were preserved for one month, developmental rate to the blastocyst was increased by adding trehalose. The best result was obtained when 0.5M trehalose were used. More than half of embryos fertilized with preserved freeze-dried spermatozoa developed to blastocyst, which was 2-3 times higher than without trehalose.

The developmental rates were recorded at each stage, from the 2-cell stage to the 16-cell stage embryos. Treatment with curcumin up to 5 μM did not cause significant decreasing in cleavage rate compared to control group. Oocytes treated with 0.5 μM and 1 μM curcumin developed to 16-cell stage similarly to control group.

After culture, dissection gave higher maturation rate (89.5%) than by aspiration (79.5%) (P<0.05). Besides, we examined the effects of activation systems on the developmental rate of parthenogenetic diploid bovine embryos. The in vitro maturation oocytes were 5 min-activated in either Calcium Ionophore A23187 (5 µM) or Ionomycin (5 µM or 10 µM) and following by either 6-Dimethylamino purine (2 mM) in 3 h or Cycloheximide (10 µg/ml) in 5 h. A combination of A23187 (5µM) and CHX (10µg/mL) indicates better results comparing to others in cleavage rates, including formation of the 2-cell (84.1%), the 4-cell (59.1%), the 8-cell (29.5%) stage embryo (P<0.05). In contrast, the lowest rate was given by combination of Ionomycin (5µM) and 6-DMAP (2mM): 65.0% for two-cell embryos, 42.5% for four-cell embryos, and 22.5% for eight-cell embryos. In conclusion, this study suggested that oocyte collection by dissection produce higher amount of oocyte collection as well as greater maturation rate than by aspiration.

METHOD: The bio-mate flow path incorporating the connector electrode is filled with fresh porcine blood and circulated by a centrifugal pump. Calcium chloride and sodium citrate are added to the circulating system to adjust ACT (Activated clotting time) to be around 160 sec. In the case that the thrombus formation detected by permittivity measurement, heparin is added to stop the coagulation reaction, and the measurement is terminated. RESULTS: Thrombus parameter is not affected by ACT change or drug addition and it increased to 20% at the end of the experiment, which confirms the feasibility of the proposed thrombus detecting sensor. As thrombus is not confirmed in extracorporeal blood circulating system besides the connector gap, it is considered to be the early stage of thrombus formation.

This technology will assist doctors as well as dermatologists in making a quick assessment of skin pathologies. Researching on the propagation of polarized light in randomly scattering media have been investigated as a new and a huge potential methodology for disease early detection. Accordingly, a fundamental understanding of how polarized light propagates through tissue is essential for the development clinically useful optical diagnostic systems because of its practical application, especially in non-invasive diagnosis. The purpose of this research concentrated on the interaction of polarized light and biological tissues utilizing Mueller matrix and Stokes parameter description for extracting nine optical parameters such as linear birefringence (LB), linear dichroism (LD), circular birefringence (CB), circular dichroism (CD), linear depolarization (L-Dep), and circular depolarization (C-Dep) properties. The samples of the healthy skin and the non-melanoma skin cancer extracted from mouse were analyzed and compared their effective optical characterization. The experimental results illustrated that the LB and LD of the disease samples tend to be larger than the standard samples, creating an innovating solid foundation for the diagnosis of skin cancer in the future.

However, those methods which involve finger puncturing are invasive, expensive as well as painful. Also, there are risks of infectious diseases using these techniques due to the contact of the needle on human skin. This paper proposed a non-invasive glucose monitoring system utilizing the near-infrared (NIR) light to make a measurement of the glucose concentration in the human blood. The designed system uses a 980nm-wavelength NIR LED transmitting through D-glucose phantom samples, a photo-sensor for analyzing the transmitting optical parameters, a filter & an amplifier circuit, and a Nano Arduino microcontroller. For calculating the values of glucose concentration, the R programming with the methodology of the artificial neural network (ANN) was applied. This type of methodology is considered as one of the most useful technique in the world of data analysis and because it is adaptive, learns from the provided information and optimizes for better prediction outcomes. The obtained glucose level is demonstrated directly on the system’s screen or further sent to the user’s mobile phone. The result obtained shows a correlation between the transmittance and the concentration of D-glucose solution. The correlation parameter of the technique is 2 0.9972 R = . Despite having the acceptable results, there are still some improvements that could be carried out for more accurate measurement (angle of the LED, a procedure of filtering and amplifying, usage of an optical instrument…).

One device was designed and built – from a Philips UVB Narrow-band medical lamp and a controlling digital circuit comprising of an 89S52 microcontroller, a LCD screen, and a DS1307 real-time clock – to illuminate the psoriasis lesions in a controllable exposing time. An in vitro study was established on mouse skin fibroblasts to investigate the effect of NB-UVB on cell proliferation and morphology. The efficacy and safety of the lamp were also examined on two patients of psoriasis. The obtained results showed no significant abnormal change in morphology and growth of the irradiated fibroblasts. Furthermore, in patients undergoing the therapy, improvement was observed after 6 weeks of treatment. The psoriasis scales were fewer and the skin was softer and less flushed. The skin lesions also did not itch and spread out. The mechanism of action of the proposed treatment, however, remains not fully understood and would be further studied by investigating the effect of NB-UVB on key cell types involved in the pathogenesis of the disease including the keratinocytes and the T lymphocytes.

The first step for this is to compute a hologram from multi-layer images captured by CT or MRI scanners in the form of DICOM via pyramid hologram, with the use of Matlab programming language and a lot of it’s available functions for image processing. The whole procedure of the team research contains six main steps. The first four steps include: reconstructing 3D images from a folder of CT or MRI multi-layer images, capturing four orthogonal projections of the 3D image, arranging these four side views into one appropriate png image, saving the final image. Step five is to reduce a layer from the original folder of CT or MRI multi-layer images and repeating the first four steps until running out of layers inside the folder, gradually. All the saved images for each layer reduction will be computed into a video which can show the outside through the inside of the images from CT or MRI scanner via a pyramid hologram. Users can pause the video at any time to show the structure of the images they desire.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial role in cancer development. TAMs are classified into classical activated M1 phenotype and alternative activated M2 phenotype under specific stimuli in tumor microenvironment. While M1 macrophages induce pro-inflammation and tumoricidal activity, M2 macrophages promote tumor progression. The poor survival of several cancers (including neuroblastoma) has been assigned to high M2 macrophages presentation. Meanwhile, studies on some cancers reported high M1 infiltration was associated with improved survival. However, the contribution of M1 macrophages has not been well studied in neuroblastoma. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages in association with patients ‘survival expectation. To evaluate activation status of M1 and M2 macrophages, we isolated TAMs from neuroblastoma tumors and quantified their biomarker gene expression using RT-qPCR. A remarkably high infiltration of M1 macrophages in tumor was observed with high event-free survival and very low risk. Meanwhile, an M2-populated polarization was the status in poor outcome cases. Collectively, these data suggest that a higher ratio of M1/M2 polarized macrophages results in better survival from VL to IR. This study supports promising treatment targeting TAMs polarization for survival improvement in neuroblastoma patients.

It has received considerable attention and research efforts over the past decade because it exerts a major impact on human health, from metabolism to immunity. In a recent study, we identified novel anticancer Azurin-like peptides from the human gut microbiome using combined molecular biology and bioinformatics based approaches. Herein, we present the cloning, expression and partial purification of one of these peptides as a case study towards the design and development of novel anticancer peptide drugs by the use of recombinant protein engineering. Firstly, the vector pET42a(+) is used for the cloning of a peptide Cnazu8 encoded by p2seq12 (cnazu8) from Clostridium nexile DSM 1718 in E. coli OmniMAX. Secondly, this vector is further used for expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Finally, protein purification is performed in a HisPur Ni-NTA column (Thermo). The results show that the plasmid pDT008 allows Cnazu8 to express in fusion with GST-6xHis-TEV in E. coli. The optimal conditions for expression of the fusion peptide GST-6xHis-TEV-Cnazu8 (36.7 kDa) include IPTG at 0.05 mM and the temperature at 37C. However, most of the expected proteins are expressed in the insoluble forms. Thus, a sonication method for cell disruption is developed to increase the solubility of the desired proteins. The purification results in a relatively low amount of desired fusion proteins. Thus, the purification optimization and anticancer bioassays of Cnazu8 are required to further consider as a novel anticancer drug candidate.

The EOG signal can be processed separately through the horizontal and vertical channel from the surface muscle around the eye. In this paper, we propose a method to describe the characteristic of EOG signals that can be used to detect eye movements. The method consists of two (2) main parts: recurrence quantification analysis to estimate the behavior of EOG signal and state space analysis to identify different types of eye movement.

Determining the time of transition between stages allows for accurate assessment of sleep quality and development of early alert applications. The major of this study is focused on using the portable electroencephalography (EEG) device for sleep staging. The study used two devices Nicolet One V32 and Emotiv EPOC to analyze the different characteristics of the brain signal in Sleep onset. Analysis results show that the similarity of the two devices reached over 80%, indicating the possibility of using the low-cost device Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset replacing clinical EEG system in sleep studies.

Acquisition of effective, goal-oriented communication skills has been shown to improve the dentist-patient relationship and requires both practicing skills and reflective thinking. The use of technologies such as video-recording to communicate directly and individually with students can be used to enhance students’ engagement and communication skills. This paper aims to present the results of the implementation of the video recording of role-plays and self-reflection in the training of communication skills of first-year dental students at Griffith University, Australia. The year 2015 was used as a control, and in 2016 we introduced video recording, and in 2017 self-reflection. The tools used to measure the impact of these teaching instruments were: (1) student evaluation of courses (SEC) data, and (2) results of the final practical exam grades in the Communication Skills for Oral Health Course. The skills assessed and reflected on include: verbal and non-verbal communication, metacommunication, self-confidence, rapport, active listening, and mindfulness. Recordings and facilitator''s feedback can be accessed by each student for their self-reflection on their overall performance, communication skills, patient-centered approach and strategies on how to improve their skills. Results of the SEC data show enhancements in engagement (68% to 83% +ve answers), assessment (66% to 78% +ve answers) and feedback (81% to 89% +ve answers). Results of their average final practical marks increased from 57.82% (control) to 63.34% (with video), and finally 79.64% (with video and self-reflection). These results strongly suggest that the inclusion of the digital recording of role play interactions and self-reflection increases the quality of communication skills training for dental students by enhancing their dentist-patient relationship skills, engagement, confidence, satisfaction with assessment and the quality of the feedback that can be provided.

Materials and method: The reference framework on which the model would be based will be established. In this respect, the natural cartilage structure would be reviewed and then idealized for computational investigation based on known physical and biochemical attributes of the tissue. A cellular automaton method that would extend current capabilities beyond that obtainable with finite element analysis, meshed and meshfree, and similar methods are attempted. Results and discussion: A modelling protocol that consistently enables the idealization of this complex heterogeneous biological gel has been obtained. This model would enable the computational probing of the loaded cartilage matrix and facilitate case studies and simulation including visualization of conditions that are practically impossible in laboratory experiments. Conclusion: The approach is helpful in capturing the micro-scale processes governing the deformation of articular cartilage. In the near future, cellular automata and rules of advection will be combined to simulate pressure development and redistribution in the tissue matrix.

In this study, we used tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a precursor of the sol-gel reaction to form organosilicate and added fumed silica nano particles for additional sol-gel reaction to induce roughness and hydroxyl groups on the film. The film is coated with synthesized organosilicate on the glass substrate by dipping method and the film showed superhydrophilic property. Such a superhydrophilic organosilicate film showed low protein adsorption behavior and antimicrobial effect by preventing the biofilm by forming a water film on the surface. Therefore, our results is expected to be applicated in medical devices due to superhydrophilic organosilicate’s high mechanical properties and biocompatibility with antimicrobial effect.', 4014, N'2018-06-29 08:00:00', N'2018-06-29 17:30:00', N'105.

Ongoing research investigation is devoted to have a better understanding of its anti-cancer activities and to overcome side effects and drug resistance. In this work, electronic structure of 5-FU molecule in various solvents is investigated from first principles. Our results exhibit that exact exchange contribution to the electron-electron interaction is important to optimize bond angles while correlation term is important for bond lengths. B3LYP/cc-pDVZ is the best basis set for calculation of IR-active vibration. It is found that diffusion functions included into Gaussian wave-function basis sets over-estimate dipole moment of the molecule. At low dielectric constant region, the dipole moment of the 5-FU molecule increases quickly but then reaches saturated value around 5.10 D at dielectric constant higher than 30. There is a correlation between the change of HOMO-LUMO gap and the change of C-C bond length induced by the electrostatic interaction between the molecule and solvents.
